# Problem1
This is my first code challenge.
# Run Through of what the code entails
This is my first code challenge.
I have worked on two projects,each with comments to accompany my code
The firsst one is a Grade Converter where you input a score and the score is converted to a grade
Scores below 0 or above 100 are invalid and you therefore get instructed to re-enter the grade
The second project is a sort of Speed Gun that once a certain speed is inputed, it checks whether it is above the speed limit and by how much
Once it does this,the points are calculated depending on how much you have ecveeded the speed limit
Once the points tally to 12, the driver's licence is suspended.
